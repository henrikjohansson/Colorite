This is the source code for the Find-program that is used to identify the target in the image. For Windows, MS Visual Studio Express 2010 was used for the development, hence the additional files. 

As written in the manual, Find uses the OpenCV framework. Please follow the instructions in the manual to install OpenCV.

If no changes are needed in the identification process, it should be possible to use the contain find.exe. For this case, the dll-files in the Find-directory must be used.

Colorite is a flexible cross-platform software solution for automatic target-based analysis and improvement of image quality. The software is a major part of the National Library of Sweden’s ongoing effort to create a fully automatic post-processing workflow. The Colorite software conforms to the image quality specifications and guidelines set forth in both the FADGI and the Metamorfoze initiatives (2011). Before the quality of an image is analyzed with Colorite, the user can specify the exact criteria to be employed for the analysis.

Colorite employs state-of-the-art image matching algorithms to allow for the use of both arbitrary targets and arbitrary target placements. The software makes extensive use of XML to store comprehensive information about both the result of the image analysis and about the employed target. This information is suitable to be included in a Submission Information Packet. Colorite has successfully been deployed in both Windows and Mac environments.

The development of Colorite started at The National Library of Sweden. When the main author left the library, the decision was made to make to Colorite available to the public, without restrictions, to facilitate further development and a larger user base.
